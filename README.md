HASAD is a smart farming system designed to support small farmers through virtual sensing, data-driven services. The complete HASAD system is planned to provide the following three core services:

1. Irrigation Recommendation emgine:
    Provides reccomendations on optimal irrigation timing and quantity based on real time weather data.
2. Disease Risk Prediction Service:
    Predicts crop disease risks early by an ML model with the data collected from the weather.
3. Agricultural AI Assistant:
    Offers interactive advisory support by answering farmer questions and providing agricultural guidance.

HASAD (MVP): As part of this project, an initial implementation (MVP) of HASAD was developed with a focus on validating the core CI/CD workflows. The MVP includes:

1. User registration and secure authentication.
2. Frontend–backend communication using REST APIs.
3. Retrieve real-time weather data from an external WeatherMap API for the specfic farm location by the (longitude and latitude).
4. Visualization of weather information through a simple and user-friendly dashboard.
5. Containerized deployment using Docker and CI/CD pipelies

This initial implementation demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed HASAD system and provides a solid foundation for extending the platform to include the full set we discussed in the report..
